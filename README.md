# DESCRIPTON IN DETAIL

This project was completed by a team of 13 people for the CSE 396 Computer Engineering Project. The main goal of this project is making a robot which is capable of searching items, generating 2D map and autonomous movement. This project consists of 5 five modules which are hardware, autonomous movement, mapping, image processing, and communication modules and I took part on all modules except the image processing.
